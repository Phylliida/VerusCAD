# vcad-operators
Verified Euler-operator layer (Phase 6 scaffold).

Current scope (initial scaffold):
1. Workspace-integrated crate stub for upcoming Euler-operator APIs and proofs.
2. Verification entrypoint via `scripts/verify-vcad-operators.sh`.
3. Detailed Phase 6 burndown checklist at `docs/todo-operators.sh`.

Planned role in stack:
`vcad-math -> vcad-geometry -> vcad-topology -> vcad-operators -> vcad-kernel`.
