Added a segment-triangle strict-crossing boundary-vertex regression and removed a temporary projection Vec allocation in vcad-geometry, documented a reverted ghost-contract attempt, reran proof lanes (`./scripts/test-vcad-geometry-verus-proofs.sh`, `./scripts/verify-vcad-geometry.sh` => `205 verified, 0 errors`), and 23 Phase 5 upstream-lemmas checklist items remain with blockers on the missing segment-triangle iff refinement plus unresolved L1/L2/L3/L4/L5/L6 proof gaps.
