Added a verified quaternary convex-combination positivity lemma in vcad-geometry and revalidated proof lanes (`./scripts/test-vcad-geometry-verus-proofs.sh` and `./scripts/verify-vcad-geometry.sh`, now 205 verified, 0 errors); 20 Phase 5 upstream-lemmas checklist tasks remain, with primary blockers still the missing n-ary convex-combination wrapper and unresolved L1/L2/L4/L6 geometric proof gaps.
