Added an L6 intermediate proof in `segment_intersection.rs` (`lemma_parameter_from_opposite_signed_constraints_has_open_unit_signs` plus signum/num bridge lemmas) and documented it in `phase5-upstream-lemmas.md`, with `./scripts/test-vcad-geometry-verus-proofs.sh` and `./scripts/verify-vcad-geometry.sh` both green (`228 verified, 0 errors`), while 20 checklist tasks remain and the immediate blocker is still wiring these parameter-sign facts into the remaining Proper-case closed-segment-bound proof (`point_on_both_segments_spec`) alongside other open L1/L2/L3/L4/L5/L6 gaps.
