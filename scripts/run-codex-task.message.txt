Added a seeded differential/property-based Phase 5 harness that checks broad-phase intersection results against the no-cull oracle across randomized valid/adversarial meshes, added a trusted-boundary source guard test, and updated the burndown log/checklists with full revalidation (250 verified, 0 errors).
